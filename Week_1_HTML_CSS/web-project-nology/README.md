## Project: Intro to Web


### Overview
Well done on completing your first couple of modules as part of nology! Hopefully you are
excited to start building things, and are feeling more confident with the web technologies you
have been taught.

To cement these concepts (HTML, CSS, Git, Flex etc) we would like you to build a project, which
you will submit ahead of starting the course with us. We would like you to build a landing page
to match a document which can be found below this one in Absorb (it is named “Landing -
mobile.jpg”). This is a build-to-spec challenge so we are looking for you to cement your skills,
but also get as close as possible to the image we have provided.
One thing to note is that this image is representative of a mobile screen, so you should write
your styles to reflect this.

### Specifications
1. At least 10 commits: Regular commits are an important part of being a developer. It
allows you to check-point your work, and if need be, return back to older versions of your
code.

2. Pushed to GitHub: Using the videos on GitHub, we would like this project to be pushed to
GitHub.

3. Use flex and/or grid: Use flex and/or grid to position your elements (where applicable)
on the page (you’ll thank us later)
Good Luck!
